suddenly appear in a blank, 3D landscape. there is a small spaceship in the center of the screen, and the camera is positioned just behind it, and pointed in the same direction as the spaceship. the spaceship is very minimal, composed of say, 20 - 30 black lines at most

in front of the spaceship is a single black ring encompassing most of the screen

the user is prompted to enter a url for a soundcloud track

if the track successfully loads, a bunch of black rings materialize behind the existing one. they form a tunnel, with length proportionate to the length of the track

the spaceship starts flying through the rings

all rings are responding to the audio being played, acting as circular spectrum analyzers. all rings are responding identically to one another. frequencies will be arranged around each ring logarithmically, so that lower frequencies take up as much of the ring's circumference as the higher frequencies. the amplitude at a particular frequency at any point in time, will be represented as the radius of that frequency's corresponding section of the ring's circumference

so, the spaceship is flying through a sort of tunnel-like audio visualizer

at any moment, if the user want's to listen to another track, they can press a key. when they press that key, in the distance we see that the tunnel is ending, and at the very end of it is some sort of spherical space. the spaceship moves through the last part of the tunnel, and enters this new spherical space.

arranged around this sphere are entrances to 5 new tunnels, each one corresponding to a related track (as determined by soundcloud). the first tunnel is directly in front of the exit of the tunnel we were previously in. the other 4 are to the left, right, top, and bottom. the tunnel we just exited is now closed off.

in this sphere, the spaceship can move freely. as it flies towards the entrance of any of these new tunnels, the user can hear a quiet preview of the related track.

when a user flies into a tunnel, the track fades in, the audio visualization starts for that track, the spaceship starts moving, and things proceed as they did before.

at any moment, the user can press a key to 'like' a track. since the user is logged in via soundcloud, liking a track in track-miner likes it on their soundcloud account as well.

### in the future:

the user can fast-forward through a track. when they do, the spaceship speeds up, the background blurs, and spectrum analysis halts. when they slow back down again, things proceed as they did before

build more audio visualizations, and let the user cycle between them
